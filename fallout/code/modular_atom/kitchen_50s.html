<p>Once upon I time I started with 50s style kitchen utensils to suit Fallout better than the TG ones. This is just updating that, adding some stuff, and keeping it collected since its a set. Mostly art, some minor related code polish.</p>
<p>Core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>All 50s or straight from Fallout, no sci-fi stuff.</li>
<li>Correct perspective, uniform palette/lighting for the art (more or less)</li>
<li>For items, onmobs must work, no invisible sprites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-it-complete">Is it complete?</h2>
<p>Yes, sort of. Its fully functional and I might not make any more content for it.</p>
<h2 id="outside-reliance">Outside reliance?</h2>
<p>To work properly with sounds and minimize chance for errors it is a good idea to comment out the two near identical code blocks in washing_machine.dm thats included in this module.
Same goes for microwave.dm. For the food preparation area, it needs to replace /area/crew_quarters/kitchen in butchering.dm to be useful.</p>
<h2 id="who-dunnit">Who dunnit</h2>
<p>Art: juicer, microwave, stove, fridge_good, chopping block, washing machine, knife_kitchen - me
bowl, rolling pin and butcher knife based on legacy sprites, edited a bunch. Their onmobs are new, made by me. New meatspike, based heavily on the old one.
fridge is legacy, just here for safekeeping since its great, credit to its maker, it was not me.
Code: is from Citadel, AffectedArc I believe. I just did edits to correct some wonky feedback messages, add sounds, that sort of thing.
Sound: washing machine, chopping block. -me</p>

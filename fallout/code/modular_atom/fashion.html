<p>Pebbles the 2nd. Credits at the end.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-module">What is this module?</h2>
<p>All FO servers used the same old ancient set of hairs, parts going back 11 years and without any real direction. This module curates the content, adds some new hairstyles, removes some old ones, and redoes the majority of the existing ones to improve their quality and make them consistent.</p>
<p>Core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hair sorted like facial hair always has been, in categories. Makes it easier to find suitable hair for your character than looking through a long alphabetical list of arbitrarily named hairs.</li>
<li>Entire lineup redone, old stuff kept when decent, redone if not, tons of edits, new stuff added. Hairs as well as facial hairs.</li>
<li>Order, same in icon files as in .dms, no duplicates, no unused stuff.</li>
<li>Collects cosmetics items</li>
<li>Adds combs/brushes (mood boost, more for longer hairs)</li>
<li>Adds handheld mirrors (applies makeup, small mood boost)</li>
<li>Adds straight razor (shaves like a electric razor, only more post apoc, and slower so harder to grief with. Also can cut people up and generally fun)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-it-complete">Is it complete?</h2>
<p>Yes.
Implementing the module might affect saved character profiles, it will certainly mess up any saved hairs and facial hairstyles 100% since the code saves user profiles by bitflags or something, so changing the order of the hairs in any way causes some annoyances. Something to be aware of, players can just reselect their hair and save and its fine so its no biggie.
Clothing will be affected by repaths/reorgs up-path to some degree. The reason to have them in the module is to keep the sets together, so it does not get spread out and lost.</p>
<p>The Angel Eyes, Blondie, and Tuco sets are just spawners at the moment, can be added where appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="who-dunnit">Who dunnit</h2>
<p>Some are my own concepts, others edited from minor to total reworks of legacy or other hairstyles from bay and elsewhere, names have been changed when needed to fit the system. Basically, 90% of the hairs got minor to major edits, but also build on the older work of various unknown people.
Comb/Brush code - sparklingsheep
Lipstick/razor code - AffectedArc07
Handheld mirror &amp; makeup, curating and redoing sprites and the rest- Pebbles the 2nd
Straight razor - Pebbles
Clothing: Burgundy suit minor edits for sleeves, a tiny bit of shade, jacket off state and brand new icon added. Credit to the original creator, its a very nice onmob.
Laceup shoes already has a perfect icon, but the onmobs were not good, so just made new ones.
Some recolors, Tucos hat is heavily edited Vaquero hat, the stetson is a recolored drillhat.
